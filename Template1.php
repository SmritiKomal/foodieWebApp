             <p>Foodie is an Indian Restaurant chain owned by Goyal brothers. 
             Its first ever restaurant was opened in 2004 in Mumbai.
             We started accepting online orders for home-delivery since 2011.
             we stopped this service in 2020 keeping in view the safety of our customers.
             We take order both offline and online, and you may receive your order from 
             our restaurant only after an hour of placing the order.
             Presently we are serving mouth-watering delicacies to 15000 foodies
             each day across 12 cities all over the country.
             There are around 60 restaurants all over the country employing more than 2000 people. 
             Along with taste, nutrition content is also taken 
             care of while cooking.
             Since it came into existence, satisfaction of our customers has been our utmost priority.</p>' ?>
